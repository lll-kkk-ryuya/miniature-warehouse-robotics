"""VisualTaskResolver — pixel -> map -> known-location snap (XER3, doc02:109-159,251-252).

Turns each ``RoboticsPlanDraft`` detection's image pixel into a map point via the calibration
homography, checks it against the calibration's valid polygon and reprojection-error ceiling,
and snaps it to the nearest frozen ``KNOWN_LOCATIONS`` key within the injected snap radius AND
in object-class agreement with it (doc02:150 "距離と object class" conjunction; class info
absent on either side => distance alone decides, per doc02's own class-less example :117-133).
A target that fails any gate is ``unresolved`` with ``destination=None`` — the 0-dispatch path
(doc02:151,68): an unresolved target NEVER yields a destination.

bridge-local (発明), standalone offline core. It does NOT compile a ``Command`` and does NOT
read ``config``; the L3 chain wires it at ``pipeline.py:180`` (running caller: x_er_bridge, XER6).

Consumes:
- ``RoboticsPlanDraft`` (models/robotics_plan_draft.py) — its ``detections[].pixel`` (u, v) IS
  the per-target pixel; no bridge-local Detection input is needed (the draft already carries it).
- ``Calibration`` (the LANDED validator/seams.py:24 artifact, NOT redefined) — ``homography``
  (3x3, doc02:148), ``valid_polygon`` (doc02:151), ``reprojection_error`` (doc02:151).
- ``KNOWN_LOCATIONS`` (the frozen warehouse_interfaces vocabulary, locations.py:23).
- ``VisualPolicy`` (injected thresholds + confidence formula, policy.py).
